This quiz will self grade and email to you the student name, total correct, and a list of Correct/Incorrect status
by item number.</p>

<p>
This is a prototype but fully functional quiz.

Instructional designers: The quiz uses ArcGIS Survey123 to collect data and the webhook feature 
to send data to Integramat for email notification and grading.  SimpleHTML framesets are used to divide
the page real estate.
